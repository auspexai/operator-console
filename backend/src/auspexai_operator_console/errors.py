"""Sanitized error detail for HTTP responses (CodeQL py/stack-trace-exposure).

The console is a maintainer-only dashboard, so leaking exception text is mild
here — but it is still internal detail crossing an HTTP boundary, and the fix
costs nothing.

**Why this takes no exception argument.** Two earlier shapes both failed to
clear the finding:

1. Returning a truncated ``TypeName: message``. A real improvement — traceback
   to the log, response bounded to one line — but exception-derived data still
   crossed the boundary, and truncating tainted data leaves it tainted.
2. Taking ``exc`` as a parameter and returning only static text plus a random
   reference. Provably clean by reading, but an exception flowing INTO the
   function is enough for the analyzer to treat everything flowing out of it as
   tainted, so the alert survived.

So the exception is never passed in. Call this inside an ``except`` block:
``logger.exception`` picks the active exception up from ``sys.exc_info()`` and
writes it, with traceback, under a short random reference. The returned string
is built only from caller-supplied static text and that reference — there is no
path from the exception to the response, for a reader or an analyzer.

The cost is real and worth stating: the failure cause is no longer readable
straight off the HTTP response. The reference is what ties a report back to the
exact log line — `journalctl -u auspexai-operator-console | grep <ref>`.
